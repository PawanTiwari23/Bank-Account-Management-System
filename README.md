# Bank-Account-Management-System
Overview
This project simulates basic bank account operations such as creating an account, checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money. It serves as a way to understand the basic operations of functions, conditionals, loops, and working with variables in Python.
The system should capture the account holder’s name, account number, balance, and allow basic operations. The project can be further expanded by introducing error handling and data validation.




# Features
